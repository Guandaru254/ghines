He began his career with multinational corporations, holding senior managerial positions at Heineken, Coca-Cola International, Sony Ericsson, and Reckitt Benckiser. In 2004, after 17 years in the corporate world, he founded Allied Expertise FZE, a consulting firm specialising in governance and fraud prevention. In 2005, shortly after the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, Ghines returned to Juba. There, he established Equatoria Holding Company Ltd, which has since grown into South Sudan's largest facilities management company. In 2008, he launched Notos Café-Restaurants, the country's first homegrown restaurant chain, later expanding to Uganda and Kenya. Through Equatoria Holding's CSR programs, he has directed resources toward trauma healing, youth empowerment, and animal conservation, continuing a family tradition of public service in South Sudan spanning more than 130 years. He has also served as Honorary Consul for Canada and is a founding member of the Rotary Club of Juba. As a founding member of the Ghines Foundation, his vision is to harness the energy and creativity of South Sudan's youthful population and channel it toward building a nation defined by opportunity, stability, and renewal.`,
